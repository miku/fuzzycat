      "content": "Discovering all the genetic causes of a phenotype is an important goal in\nfunctional genomics. In this paper we combine an experimental design for\nmultiple independent detections of the genetic causes of a phenotype, with a\nhigh-throughput sequencing analysis that maximizes sensitivity for\ncomprehensively identifying them. Testing this approach on a set of 24 mutant\nstrains generated for a metabolic phenotype with many known genetic causes, we\nshow that this pathway-based phenotype sequencing analysis greatly improves\nsensitivity of detection compared with previous methods, and reveals a wide\nrange of pathways that can cause this phenotype. We demonstrate our approach on\na metabolic re-engineering phenotype, the PEP/OAA metabolic node in E. coli,\nwhich is crucial to a substantial number of metabolic pathways and under\nrenewed interest for biofuel research. Out of 2157 mutations in these strains,\npathway-phenoseq discriminated just five gene groups (12 genes) as\nstatistically significant causes of the phenotype. Experimentally, these five\ngene groups, and the next two high-scoring pathway-phenoseq groups, either have\na clear connection to the PEP metabolite level or offer an alternative path of\nproducing oxaloacetate (OAA), and thus clearly explain the phenotype. These\nhigh-scoring gene groups also show strong evidence of positive selection\npressure, compared with strictly neutral selection in the rest of the genome.",
