This charge ordering is stripe-like, being characterized by\na wave vector q ~ (0,0,0.3) with very anisotropic correlation parallel and\nperpendicular to the stripe direction. This charge ordering is specific to the\nmanganites with relatively wide one-electron band width (W) which often exhibit\na metallic A-type AFM state, and should be strictly distinguished from the\nCE-type checkerboard-like charge ordering which is commonly observed in\nmanganites with narrower W such as La{1-x}Ca{x}MnO{3} and Pr{1-x}Ca{x}MnO{3}.",
