By following Sheffield-Smart \\cite{SS}, we\nderive $\\De_\\infty$ with respect to the dual operator norm and show that such\nmaps miss information along a hyperplane when compared to Tight Maps. We\nrecover the lost term which causes non-uniqueness and derive the complete\nAronsson system which has \\emph{discontinuous coefficients}. In particular, the\nEuclidean $\\infty$-Laplacian is $\\De_\\infty u = Du \\ot Du : D^2u\\, +\\,\n|Du|^2[Du]^\\bot \\De u$ where $[Du]^\\bot$ is the projection on the null space of\n$Du^\\top$. We exibit $C^\\infty$ solutions having interfaces along which the\nrank of their gradient is discontinuous and propose a modification with $C^0$\ncoefficients which admits \\emph{varifold solutions}. Away from the interfaces,\nAronsson Maps satisfy a structural property of local splitting to 2 phases, an\nhorizontal and a vertical; horizontally they possess gradient flows similar to\nthe scalar case and vertically solve a linear system coupled by a scalar\nHamilton Jacobi PDE. We also construct singular $\\infty$-Harmonic local $C^1$\ndiffeomorphisms and singular Aronsson Maps.",
