      "content": "This paper introduces Taco-VC, a novel architecture for voice conversion (VC)\nbased on the Tacotron synthesizer, which is a sequence-to-sequence with\nattention model. Most current prosody preserving VC systems suffer from target\nsimilarity and quality issues in the converted speech. To address these\nproblems, we first recover initial prosody preserving speech using a Phonetic\nPosteriorgrams (PPGs) based Tacotron synthesizer. Then, we enhance the quality\nof the converted speech using a novel speech-enhancement network, which is\nbased on a combination of phoneme recognition and Tacotron networks. The final\nconverted speech is generated by a Wavenet vocoder conditioned on Mel\nSpectrograms. Given the advantages of a single speaker Tacotron and Wavenet, we\nshow how to adapt them to other speakers with limited training data. We\nevaluate our solution on the VCC 2018 SPOKE task. Using public mid-size\ndatasets, our method outperforms the baseline and achieves competitive results",
