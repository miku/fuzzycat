Scientific works (monographs, articles, dissertations and abstracts of dissertations) of native and foreign authors for the period from 1928 to 2017 were worked out to achieve the goal. Data on the variants of artery discharge, areas of blood supply and major anomalies are presented. The size characteristics of arteries (length, outer diameter, wall thickness and lumen diameter) are presented taking into account bilateral, age and sexual differences.</p>",
