      "content": "We study the averaged action of the Randall-Sundrum model with a time\ndependent metric ansatz. It can be reformulated in terms of a Brans-Dicke\naction with time dependent Newton's constant. We show that the physics of early\nuniverse, particularly inflation, is governed by the Brans-Dicke theory. The\nBrans-Dicke scalar, however, quickly settles to its equilibrium value and\ndecouples from the post-inflationary cosmology. The deceleration parameter is\nnegative to start with but changes sign before the Brans-Dicke scalar settles\nto its equilibrium value. Consequently, the brane metric smoothly exits\ninflation. We have also studied the slow-roll inflation in our model and\ninvestigated the spectra of the density perturbation generated by the radion\nfield and find them consistent with the current observations.",
